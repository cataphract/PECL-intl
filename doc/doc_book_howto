This document explains how to debug documentation for 'intl'
extension and how to quickly compile a stripped version of the PHP
manual to check your changes.

1. Unpack the PHP Manual sources to phpdoc/ directory.

2. Run the following command in phpdoc/ directory:

  $ autoconf

3. Remove everything under phpdoc/en/reference/ and place documentation
on 'intl' extension there. After that the directory will contain only
one 'intl' subdirectory.

4. Edit phpdoc/manual.xml.in: remove everything from the <book> section
and add a single line to that section:

 &builtin.extensions;

This will make the manual contain only intl API reference. Such
a stripped manual compiles *much* faster.

5. Insert all entries found in intl-doc/global.ent to
   phpdoc/entities/global.ent.

6. Run the following command in phpdoc/ directory:

  $ ./configure
  
Configure runs numerous PHP scripts, preparing the manual sources for
compilation. Besides, they create/overwrite functions.xml file under
phpdoc/en/reference/intl/. Just ignore it.

7. Run the following command in  phpdoc/ directory:

  $ make
  
8. Make may fail, but that's ok. :-) You'll find the compiled manual
under phpdoc/html/.

NOTE:
You may encounter "???" marks in the compiled manual.
They mean (dead) links to non-existent sections.
